Getting started - 

To start with collecting data, we need select a website or a web page that has data we need to scrape.
Using 'ureq' library we can open the webpage to read the page a save the information in html format and close the connecton.
Now that we have the data in html format we use beautfulsoap library to parse through the data and get specific information from the tags.
Repeat the step of reading the information using bsoup and save them.
Once we have all the lists with different data, we can create a csv file and save them as columns.

Now we have data source in csv format and can use this data to analyze and create solutions.
